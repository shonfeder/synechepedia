=org-publish= was taking an absurd amount of time to publish updates. [[https://bastibe.de/2014-05-07-speeding-up-org-publishing.html][Bastion
Bechtold's note]] describing how they diagnosed and fixed a similar slowdown
helped guide me. The main trick was running the profiler to reveal what was
causing the slowdown:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(progn (profiler-start 'cpu) (function-to-profile) (profiler-report))
#+END_SRC

After fixing the cause of the slowdown, the time needed to publish these org
files to HTML is down by at least 75%.
