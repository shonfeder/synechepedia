#+TITLE: (Dis|En)abled

Confronting our communities with our /dis/ability, we call for access.

Ensuring the demands for access are satisfied, we /en/able needs to be better
met for all.

So those whose situation currently manifests as /dis/ability are the vanguard
for improved access, which /en/ables better nurtured communities.
