#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*anxious (adj.)*

1620s, "greatly troubled by uncertainties," from Latin /anxius/
"solicitous, uneasy, troubled in mind" (also "causing anxiety, troublesome"),
from /angere/, /anguere/ "to choke, squeeze," figuratively "to torment, cause
distress" (from PIE root /*angh-/ "tight, painfully constricted, painful"). The
same image is in Serbo-Croatian /tjeskoba/ "anxiety," literally "tightness,
narrowness."

* A recollection towards loosening the squeeze

There is thinking.

Here is awareness, presence, caring.

So long as there can be (thinking|awareness|presence|caring)

- the thinking can be cautious
- the awareness can be caring
- the caring can be compassionate
- the present will be as it is
