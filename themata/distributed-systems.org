#+TITLE: Distributed Systems

A system is said to be distributed when

- There are distinct, autonomous "computational entities"
- The autonomous entities communicate with each other by "message passing"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A distributed system may have a common goal, such as solving a large
computational problem;[10] the user then perceives the collection of autonomous
processors as a unit. Alternatively, each computer may have its own user with
individual needs, and the purpose of the distributed system is to coordinate the
use of shared resources or provide communication services to the users.[11]
