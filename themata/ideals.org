#+TITLE: Ideals

I'm inclined to develop understanding and voice views from an idealistic
perspectives, but I hope not to be dogmatically fixated on the corresponding
ideology.

I hope to collaborate on the millennia-long project of cultivating a
sustainable, radically emancipatory, reflexive thinking and being within the
world.

What we do, and not do, should be in consideration of the shape our actions will
take over the course of the longest imaginable run.

The only way to aim our actions over these timescales is to keep ideal limits in
view.  But, of course, to live and work in the world requires much more
immediate actions and many short term decisions, so there is a constant tension
to balance between the regulative force of the ideal limit and the exigencies of
the moment.
