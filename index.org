*** The formal paradoxes of the early 20th century
    I suspect that a common root of these was the use of /general logic/ as an
    *organon*. In Kant's critical philosophy, he admonishes against this,
    warning that will produce monstrous results.

    To use logic as an organon is to use it to extend our knowledge. That is
    done whenever we try to reason from purely general logical principles to
    existence of any sort. This occurs in the axiom of unrestricted
    comprehension.

     Containment is a candidate for transcendental techniques.

     Containers (pockets, bags, boxes, tins, gourds, jugs, cabinets, etc.) are
     so ubiquitous that very few of us appreciate how revolutionary and
     indispensable the technology is.
