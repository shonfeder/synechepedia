#+TITLE: Against the State Machinists

In a letter addressed posthumously to Alan Turing, Giuseppe Longo laments the
conceptual and technological cul-de-sac into which the state machinsts are
driving us:

To this we have to add the madness, as I mentioned, of the "everything is
computational", starting from the analysis of the living, the opposite of what
you [Turing] were able to offer, and creating the myth of the Universe as a
Turing Machine, against your very precise observations. These colleagues, who
are using the only technique that they know, and applying it to every possible
phenomenon, flattening it onto a universe that is witout meaning and made only
of formal calculations, act as if yours is the last machine that [humans] will
be capable of inventing: it is coterminous with the world! I am convinced thta
we shall invent others, but these prophesies risk becoming self-affirming:
piling computational techniques onto computational techniques, always in the
same theoretical universe, to grasp the complexity of the Universe (or the brain,
of DNA ...), in increasingly and abstrusively difficult ways without the very
simple purity and depth that mathematical invention rquires -- all of this
prevents us from being able to think about the ... next machine, which humankind
will certainly find ways of inventing.
