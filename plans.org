#+TITLE: Plans

Things I am (or hope to) make and explore.

* In Progress
** [[https://github.com/shonfeder/nd_project][ND_Project]] Mobile/web Pedagogical Natural Deduction Game
- along the lines of the iOS game *Euclid*
- teaches principles and techniques of logical reasoning
- as you master elimination/introduction rules, you expand your abilities
- as you identify important theorems, you get cuts that expand your powers
* Sketches
** [[file:plans/writing-assitant.org][A Writing Assistant]]
** [[https://github.com/shonfeder/summer][Summer]]: A programming language based on term logic
* Intimations
** Natural Deduction Games
*** Party game
- Possible title: "Unnatural Deductions"
**** Ideas
(Just a sketch)
- Tile placing
  - scrabble:
    - building off each others sequences
    - can lay multiple tiles in a chain of deductions
  - hive
    - The "board" is constructed as tiles are placed
    - can revise the board shape by certain moves
      - (E.g. cuts)
- Players state axioms
  - Axioms must be allowed by consensus (assumed consent, but a single veto
    blocks axiom positing)
- Cuts can be declared
  - clears the board of (some) tiles
  - introduces new theorems
  - How?
    - Special "cut" tiles?
      - Allows for capturing tiles that are cut out
      - Can only add captured tiles to points if you can reintroduce the cut?
- Win/loss conditions?
  - Immediate victory: Proving Falsum (should be rare)
  - Tile capturing: via cut introduction. And any other means?
- Different logical systems as expansions
- The content of the theorems provide color (like other party games)
- Award points based also on amusingness of deduced theorems?
