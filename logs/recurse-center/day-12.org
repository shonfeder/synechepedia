*Existence.* One can instead contend that [the existence of] objects are
 anterior to their type, seen as an essence. This is the viewpoint of
 /subtyping/, this is also the viewpoint of ludics: an object may have several
 types, be representative of several essences. Their /locativity/ becomes
 essential.

I let my mind roam free today. It found its way back refreshed. I have some
notes to review and organize, and I'll type up the relevant bits tomorrow.

* Tomorrow's Program

** PLT
- Attend Haskell CoHack in afternoon, where I'll work on porting Haskell's
  Align library to OCaml.
** Writing
- Evaluate and type up notes from tonight
- Reflect on reconnecting with poetic origination
