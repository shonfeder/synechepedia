What really pleased me was the neat parallel established between Emmy Noether's
insight that algebra is the study of sets with structure given by operations,
and David Parnas' insight that modules should encapsulat data with operations;
more than that, the algebraic approach establised and equivalence between
abstractness in ADTs and abstractness in algebra; furthermore, equations among
operations came into specifications of ADTs the same way as in abstract algebra.
