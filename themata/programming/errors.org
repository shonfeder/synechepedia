/error/ (n.) also, through 18c., /errour/; c. 1300, "a deviation from truth made
through ignorance or inadvertence, a mistake," also "offense against morality or
justice; transgression, wrong-doing, sin;" from Old French error "mistake, flaw,
defect, heresy," from Latin errorem (nominative error) "a wandering, straying, a
going astray; meandering; doubt, uncertainty;" also "a figurative going astray,
mistake," from errare "to wander; to err" (see err). From early 14c. as "state
of believing or practicing what is false or heretical; false opinion or belief,
heresy." From late 14c. as "deviation from what is normal; abnormality,
aberration." From 1726 as "difference between observed value and true value."

Words for "error" in most Indo-European languages originally meant "wander, go
astray" (for example Greek plane in the New Testament, Old Norse villa,
Lithuanian klaida, Sanskrit bhrama-), but Irish has dearmad "error," from dermat
"a forgetting."

** Internal errors should trigger patch and update process
- Can search commit history for same traceback errors, then propose to user updating
  to a version including that commit.
- Internal errors automatically search for and then file issues (an extensible
  API for this, which can be specialized for the service -- Jira, GitLab,
  GitHub -- etc.
