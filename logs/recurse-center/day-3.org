#+TITLE: Day 3: Focusing
#+DATE: <2019-09-25 Tue>

* Vibe
Recovered. Feeling fortunate. Still a bit winded and wanting for focus.

* Today's Progress

** Community
- More pleasant, friendly, and inspiring chats. I learned heaps.
- Paired on an OCaml parsing project, and we both came away with an
  understanding of how to use =ocamllex=.
** PLT: 1ML × Type Theory
- Finished reading cite:macqueen84_modul_ml
- Began reading cite:Rossberg_2010
- Implemented a stack in 1ML
- Turned up a number of bugs and missing features in the 1ML implementation in
  the process. Some of these are quite interesting type-checking bugs, and I've
  located the locus of the problem.
- I didn't get a chance to dig into the difference between small and large
  types.
** Category theory
- Attended the HOTT-NYC reading group.
** Writing
- Wrote [[file:../../themata/programming/notes-on-1ml.org::*Modules][a short intro to 1ML modules]].
- Began putting together some notes on the history and meaning of ML modules.

* Tomorrow's Program

** PLT: 1ML × Type Theory
- Study and take notes on the distinction between small and large types in 1ML
- Continue reading cite:Rossberg_2010
- Begin trying to fix the biggest type-checking bug I found today
** Community
- Pairing to improve and rework Haskell game of like exercise
- More coffee chats
- Feelings Checkin
- Presentations
- OCaml talk at JaneStreet
** Writing
- Write up implementation of stack
- Write up notes on small vs. large types
- Start adding an epigraph to the beginning of each log entry
