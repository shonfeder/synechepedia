#+title: Communicative

* TODO What is the right name?
* Idea

- Network topology and constitution determines message propagation
- A message is a communicand (cf. operand): it is constituted thru the
  relations of communicability.
- Communication transforms the communicators
- The nodes of the network change as messages are propagated
- Ideas are people and people are ideas
- The transformation of synthesis of ideas is the creation of concepts
- An idea is an object in a communicative system
- Ideas nest: complex ideas are made up of simpler ones
- Ideas are "ideal objects" in Paul Herz' sense: i.e., they are abstractions standing
  for a pattern of inferrential relations
- From the inferrentialist perspective, all objects are ideal objects
- An inference is a relation between ideas. E.g.,
  - between people
  - between people and ideas
  - between ideas and ideas of actions (pragmatics)
- Pragmaticism is the idea that the meaning of a term is determined by the
  communication between the idea of the term and its "pragmatics", i.e., the ideas of activity that may be motivated by the commitments involving the term.
  - A "commitment" is a relation between ideas, such that the constitution of the
    committed idea is made to depend on the relations represented by the
    committent (that to which the committed commits).
- Inferrentialism holds that "inferences and the rules of inference establish
  the meaning of expressions"
  (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/proof-theoretic-semantics/#InfeIntuAntiReal))
- The transformation of communicative techniques intails tranformation of the
  communcands and the communicators.
  - A communicator is a communicand that can communciate with itself.
  - Communication is a being together (sym-ont-osis, generalization of
    symbiosis) in which
    - Sym: with, ont: being, osis: state or condition -- "the condition of being
      with"
    - The beings that are together are constituted through their togetherness
    - The activity of the beings tranforms their shared condition
    - The interaction participates in constituting their togetherness as a
      communicand
    - Communication between
- The logic should be communicative (like e.g., pi calculus)
- The logic should be dialectical (the rules and concepts develop)
