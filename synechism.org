* Logic
** Hypothesis
   The essence of inference is in the connections that actualize
   accesability. =A \vdash B= means there is "a way of getting from" (but the
   spatialization and topographical aspect of this expression needs work...)

** Elaboration
   Whether or not it be the original intention or its actual destiny, I am
   convinced (a kind of) logic /can/ be more than

   - Laws of thought (normative, subjective)
   - Structure of language
   - The science of judgment

   There is a form of logic which gives us the laws of thought, structure of
   language, science of judgment, etc., only because it pertains to the necessary
   structure of any form of relation, being, containing, connecting.
