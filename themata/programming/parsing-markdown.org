#+TITLE: Parsing Markdown

* TODO Context

In 2020, I volunteered to help maintain [[https://github.com/ocaml/omd][=omd=]], the "extensible Markdown library and
tool in 'pure OCaml'"

The ostensible extensibility in the tagline dates back to version 1. It was
based on leveraging the object system that puts the 'O' in 'OCaml'.

By the time we inherited the library, the parser had been rewritten, and the
extensibility traded in for performance. My own meager abilities were not even
up the task of making slight improvements or correction to the received block
parser, so I attempted rewrite aimed to clarify the implementation and recover
extensibility.

* Context free

- Parsing strategies.
- The sketch in the commonmark spec.
- Formal grammars. Has/can/will markdown be formalized?

* Context sensitive

* Mildly context sensitive
