#+TITLE: Bear

* etymology
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Old English beran "to bear, bring; bring forth, produce; to endure, sustain; to
wear" (class IV strong verb; past tense bær, past participle boren), from
Proto-Germanic *beran (cognates: Old Saxon beran, Old Frisian bera, Old High
German beran, German gebären, Old Norse bera, Gothic bairan "to carry, bear,
give birth to"), from PIE root *bher- (1) meaning both "give birth" (though only
English and German strongly retain this sense, and Russian has beremennaya
"pregnant") and "carry a burden, bring" (see infer).
