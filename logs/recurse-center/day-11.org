... the essence of technology is by no means anything technological. Thus we
shall never experience our relationship to the essence of technology so long as
we merely conceive and push forward the technological, put up with it, or evade
it. Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we
passionately affirm or deny it. But we are delivered over to it in the worst
possible way when we regard it as something neutral; for this conception of it,
to which today we particularly like to do homage, makes us utterly blind to the
essence of technology.

My heart and mind and body are a bit numb from the intensive programming and
type theory studies, day in and day out, over the last two weeks. I think I need
to take a short break to move around, connect with non-digitized things in the
world and revitalize.

* Today's Progress

** PLT
- Implemented the evaluator for themis' Î»2. This went fairly smoothly, and it
  was interesting to work out the substitution rule application of for
  type-level abstraction.
- Finished Chapter 4 of [cite:@rob2014type]
** Writing
I expanded, reformatted, and touched up some of the first two sections of the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube][Wikipedia entry on the lambda cube]]. I think my additions helped clarify and
communicate the main thrust of the cube, and they certainly helped me solidify
my own understanding.
** Community
Feelings checkin was remarkable. I've never participated in something quite
like it. I think every environment for collaboration should have dedicated
time to letting people emote and connect and comfort.

The pairing and chats I had planned fell through, but I had some very nice
unplanned conversations and planned some future pairs.

* Tomorrow's Program

** Fun
I'm going to read up on roguelike dungeon generation for pairing scheduled on
** PLT
1ML for realsies
** Community
I'm working from home tomorrow, to give my aching hands a rest and recoup a bit.
I have planning to participate in the Haskell CoHack all day Saturday, so I
could use a day away from the keybard.
