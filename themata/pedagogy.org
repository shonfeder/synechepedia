#+TITLE: Notes on Pedagogy

*WIP*

* Speculative and Prospective Curricula

** Thinking: Logical, Critical, and Programmatic
   A simultaneous introduction the basic concepts and practice of logical
   thinking and computer programming, guided by the aims of critical pedagogy.

*** Basic enabling analogies

****  calculation : computability :: communication : unambiguous communicability
     - We help students discover and experience the difficulty of communicating
       clear, unambiguous instructions.
     - We introduce Turing machines as a solution for this problem.
**** statement : computation :: concept : constructive & actionable cognition
     (the latter in the Kantian sense)
     - Defining computations is a way of constructing concepts.
     - Performing computations is a way of analyzing, or applying concepts.
**** writing : programming :: wish : organized, repeatable plan of action
     - We help students realize and recognize the ways in which they *already*
       write and execute programs.
     - We problematize the political and economic dimensions of this
       programming, and help them see how the are *programmed*.
**** terms : types :: proofs : propositions
     - We show students that untyped computation leads to nonsensical and
       monstrous executions.
     - We help them see the connection with nonsensical and monstrous actions
       and outcomes of plans.
     - We introduce natural deduction first (just the very basics).
     - We then introduce programs which exhibit proofs of simple deductions.
