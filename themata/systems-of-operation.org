** Cameralism: Recording Information to Manage State

The techniques which make the mechanical computer possible were already in play
in the 18th century, tracking the state of societies to make them manageable.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Government, Leibniz was convinced, was not conceivable without information.
Information, in turn, consisted of the facts and figures concerning the 'here
and now' of the state: the size of population, the quality and number of goods
and properties, mortality and birth rates, the volume of exports and imports
had, inter alia, to be known. And they had to be made visible at a glance in
order to enable the regent and his administration to act quickly and decisively.
This became possible, as Leibniz' meant, by specific means of display: the
so-called 'Staats-Tafeln' as a 'written short constitution summarizing the heart
of all information concerning the government.' Therefore, Leibniz stressed the
intrinsic connexion betwen state and knowledge.

...

The eighteenth-century Cameralists followed Leibniz by emphasizing the mediality
of politico-economical knowledge. Three medial forms were especially important
and highly regarded. The first was the list or the table, which seemed - from
the Cameralist point of view - to be of outstanding value in the most parts of
government. So Justi proposed, to cite just one example, to record the state of
industry by creating tables illustrating any change in the number or composition
of work and workers which took place in a given period.

In this regard, tables represented media of access and manipulation. Or more
generally, tables were in line with the Cameralist intention to visualize hidden
relations and forces and to make reality compatible with a program of reform and
transformation.

This also applied to a second medial form: double-entry bookkeeping. Of course,
double-entry bookkeeping was closely connected with tables. Using tables, which
should be derived from customhouse papers and related files, made it possible
for example, to record incoming and outgoing goods.

** What is a shell?

  If your familiar with the computery sense of /shell/, there's a good chance
  you think a shell is something particular to a command-line terminal
  environment. In that case, you can join me and others I've talked to in being
  delightfully surprised to learn that shell, even in the narrow computery
  sense, is a much more general thing: "a user interface for access to an
  operating system's services"[fn:1].

  The vast majority of computer users toil their entire computing day away
  inside an infamous shell that is generally unrecognized as such: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_shell][the Windows
  shell]]. The terminal-bound [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface][CLIs]] often taken to be synonymous with /shell/
  simpliciter are only a special case of a much more general concept in the
  architecture of human-computer interface.

  This concept has an interesting history and, as I will try to show,
  fascinating and important implications for how we think about the use of and
  interface with computers.

** Why go deeper into the shell?

   The aim of this remark is to solidify and share my personal meditation on the
   history, nature, and implications of the shell concept. Though I am
   primarily concerned with computer shells, a deeper understanding of their
   characteristics and potential can be nurtured by some early attention to more
   general senses of the term /shell/.

   The most concrete sense of the word is the one with physical significance.
   The most technical physical sense, used by engineers to describe a structural
   pattern, is remarkably abstract:

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   A shell is a type of structural element which is characterized by its
   geometry, being a three-dimensional solid whose thickness is very small when
   compared with other dimensions
   —[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(structure)][ wikipedia.org]]
   #+END_QUOTE

   Here, /shell/ is taken to describe a vast class of three-dimensional solids.
   *Why does it matter?*...

   To recall the more mundane and more concrete senses, we can appeal to the
   term's etymology.

   According to [[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shell&allowed_in_frame=0][etymonline.org]], the earliest etymon of /shell/ is the speculated
   Proto-Indo-European root /*skel-/, "to cut". This root claims common ground
   for a number of Germanic words with a similar sound, including the Old
   English /scealu/, "shell, husk", and others meaning "piece cut off, rind, egg
   shell", "peel", and "tile", tied to words like /*skaljo/, /skyl/, and
   /schelle/. The unifying concept suggested by etymonline is that of a
   "covering that splits off". A couple common notions take shape through these
   ancient determinations: A shell protects, hides or covers, or did so once. A
   shell is removable.

   Common senses of the term settle down to mark a topic congruent with our
   target sense as the English usage goes on:

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   Sense of "mere exterior" is from 1650s; that of "hollow framework" is
   from 1791. Meaning "structure for a band or orchestra" is attested
   from 1938.
   #+END_SRC

** What's the difference between a shell and a cli in general?

   A shell, in the computing sense, is not synonymous with a command line
   interface (CLI). Most CLIs are not shells (though most CLI are probably
   launched by a shell) and the most widely used shell is not a CLI.

   A shell is a program that provides an interface for a user to interact with
   an operating system. True to the etymological coincidence of 'shell' and
   'husk' in the Old English /scaelu/, the shell is so called because it was the
   [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husk][husk]] enclosing the operating system's /kernel/.

   This is a potent metaphor. Let's press the underlying analogy until it
   breaks, so we can see what it's made of.

   A husk is a shell that protects a seed. We sometimes think and talk as if the
   seed itself were the germ whence plants grow, but that's incorrect: plants
   grow from their /embryo/, the /germ/. A seed's destiny is to transport and
   preserve its germ until it can find fertile ground. Having found a place
   where it can settle, the seed nourishes the germ. As the germ develops into a
   seedling, the latter should break free of the shell. Thence, the germ quickly
   outgrows and consumes its kernel. If all goes will, the newly sprouted
   seedling will realize a self-sufficient form of growth, and begin feeding on
   intake from the world at large.

   A seed's husk provides protective enclosure while the seed itself nurtures
   and enables the development of the germ: given the proper conditions, this
   trinity will sprout, take root, and grow into something miraculously
   different. If a shell encloses an operating system's kernel, providing an
   interface to the user, where, if at all, do we find the analog of the germ,
   the computer's embryo? What, if anything, does this become in the optimal
   conditions?

*** The seed of the /kernel/ concept lies in the origin of the operating system

    In a nutshell, a /kernel/ is a seed program at the core of an operating
    system. The kernel maintains complete control over everything in the system,
    and orchestrates access to the underlying hardware, on which the
    computations are actually orchestrated.

    To develop an understanding of the kernel concept adequate to nurturing a
    robust understanding of the shell concept, we'll have to cultivate an
    understanding of the kernel concept that is more expansive. It is one thing
    to say "the kernel is the core of an operating system". It is another thing
    to know what an operating system is, why operating systems have cores, what
    kind of operations an operating system performs, and what kind of system it
    operates.

    We are digging for insights into the essence of the concepts rather than
    technical details about how the things that now bear those names happen to
    be constituted. Suppose I were capable of explaining the intricate technical
    details of the Linux kernel, the exact mechanisms by which it relates to,
    and is accessible from, a popular shell like Bash or Zsh, and how these
    things stand in relation to a given Linux distribution. (I am /not/ but
    let's suppose I were.) This explanation would not tell us much about the
    nature of an operating system in the /abstract/. It would tell us nothing
    about the kernel concept as such and provide very little insight into the
    essential nature and promise of the shell. To get at these things, we want a
    /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy_(philosophy)][genealogical inquiry]]/.

    The origin of the shell concept lies in that of time sharing systems. Time
    sharing systems were a pivotal innovation on the operating system: in
    essence, modern kernels are just the persistent form of the original
    operating systems. The origin of these foundational systems lies in the
    complex social and mechanical constellations of the old computing machine
    rooms.

    In order to get a visceral sense of why these machine rooms gave birth to
    operating and time sharing systems, we need a concrete understanding of what
    it was like to work with those beasts.

*** A system for efficiently operating a computing machine that fills a room

    [[file:../static/img/IBM701_in_a_machine_room.jpg]]

    http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/701.html

    In the 1950s, computing machines where gigantic, expensive, and rare. Robert
    L. Patrick worked on developing some of the earliest operating systems and
    the operational practices that preceded systematic automation. In 1987,
    Patrick was asked by ??? to prepare a paper[fn:2] reflecting on his work
    developing systems for operating these kinds of devices.

    The roots of this work go back to 1954, wrote Patrick. At that time, he was
    working on an IBM 701. The 701 was IBM's first commercial scientific
    computer. It rented for over $23,000 a month and filled a 40 foot by 40 foot
    room. It was a "single sequencing machine", meaning it could only execute
    one stage of a computation task at a time: e.g., if it was reading input, it
    was *only* reading input, not processing anything, until the entire input
    was consumed. Like other machines of this era, it was composed of an
    interrelated system of heterogeneous storage and processing devices that
    needed lots of attention and manual care: a typical configuration
    consisted of

    - a punch card reader
    - a punch card puncher (for machine-readable output)
    - a 150-line-per-minute printer (for human-readable output)
    - an internal memory of 2,000 36-bit words
    - four magnetic tapes
    - a magnetic drum

    Operating these bohemoths was intricate, complex, and fraught:

    #+BEGIN_SRC
    The typical mode of operating was programmer present and at the operating
    console. When a programmer got ready for a test shot, he or she signed up
    on a first-in, first-out list, much like the list at a crowded restaurant.
    The programmer then checked progress frequently to estimate when he would
    reach the top. When his time got close, he stod by with card deck in hand.
    When the previous person finished or ran out of alloted time or abruptly
    crashed, the next programmer rushed in, checked that the proper board was
    installed in the card reader, checked that the proper board was installed in
    the printer, checked that the proper board was installed on the punch, hung
    a magnetic tape ..., punched in on a mechanical time clock, addressed the
    console, set some switches, loaded his punched card deck in the card reader,
    prayed the first card would not jam, and pressed the load button to invoke
    the bootstrap sequence.

    If all went well, you could load a typical deck of about 300 cards and begin
    the execution of your first instruction about 5 minutes after entering the
    machine room. If only one person did all this set up and got going in five
    minutes, he bustled around the machine room like a whirling dervish.
    #+END_SRC

    According to Patrick's account, the preparation and setup rarely went
    perfectly. Butter-fingered programmers were prone to squander the entirety
    of their test time fumbling the setup and correcting for mishaps. This was
    costly: in addition to squandering the programmer's time, the tedious and
    error prone load times wasted compute time. Operating the computer was a
    manual processes and if operators worked twelve hours a day, seven days per
    week, with a rental price of $23,000 per month, compute time would still be
    priced at about $67 per hour. (That's in 1954 dollars. In 2017, it would be
    about $620 per hour.)

    This was the muck in which the operating system took root. The earliest
    steps made towards systematization recounted by Patrick were simple measures
    to improve the reliability and efficiency of operation: e.g., organizing
    programmer-operators to work in teams so there was always an assistant or
    standardizing plug boards to reduce the need for switching. Some important
    technical improvements also contributed. Most worthy of note, perhaps, was
    the advent of "interpretive programming packages", such as
    [Speedcoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcoding). These "high-level"
    languages abstracted away from hardware instructions, providing a
    human-readable language for specifying machines programs.

    The specification of an operating system was for the IBM 704, developed as a
    collaborative effort between GM and North Western ?? and the SHARE group
    ???. I will provide the highlights from Patrick's highlights, to give a
    sense for what exactly an operating system consisted in:

* Introduction

** Motivation

   I was recently made aware that I had a very shallow understanding of the
   standard Linux command line interface (CLI) shell. As I began studying
   to overcome this superficiality, I discovered that the term /shell/ invokes
   deep historical and conceptual roots and that its contemporary relevance
   extends well beyond the standard CLI's in use by IT professionals.

   If you haven't had occasion to do a deep dive into the concept of a shell,
   you might harbor the same kind of misconceptions I did. You might think that
   a shell is a CLI in general, or that a shell has something to do with
   Unix-like environments in particular (which has a kernel of truth, but only
   for historical reasons). You might know that that there are different *nix
   shells — such as /sh/, /bash/, and /zsh/ —

    The UNIX Time-sharing System A Retrospective*

    > In most ways UNIX is a very conservative system. Only a handful of its
    ideas are genuinely new. In fact, a good case can be made that it is in
    essence a modern implementation of MIT's CTSS system [1]. This claim is
    intended as a compliment to both UNIX and CTSS. Today, more than fifteen
    years after CTSS was born, few of the interactive systems we know of are
    superior to it in ease of use; many are inferior in basic design.

** Time Sharing Systems

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Time-sharing was a misnomer. While it did allow the sharing of a central
   computer, its success derives from the ability to share other resources: data,
   programs, concepts. It cracked a critical path bottleneck for writing and
   debugging programs. In theory this could have been achieved as well with a
   direct access approach. In practice it could not.

   Direct access hems users in a static framework. Evolution is unfrequent and
   controlled by central and distant agents. Creativity is out of the user's hand.

   Time sharing, as it became popular, is a living organism in which any user, with
   various degrees of expertise, can create new objects, test them, and make them
   available to others, without administrative control and hassle. With the
   internet experience, this no longer need be substantiated.

   #+END_QUOTE

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   CTSS was developed during 1963 and 64. I was at MIT on the computer center staff
   at that time. After having written dozens of commands for CTSS, I reached the
   stage where I felt that commands should be usable as building blocks for writing
   more commands, just like subroutine libraries. Hence, I wrote "RUNCOM", a sort
   of shell driving the execution of command scripts, with argument substitution.
   The tool became instantly most popular, as it became possible to go home in the
   evening while leaving behind long runcoms executing overnight.
   #+END_QUOTE
** Commands and Scripts

   The shell, at it's root, is an interface for issuing commands and observing
   the effects of their execution.

   If we have a sequence of commands we issue often, to many different actors,
   we might get sick of repeating ourselves so much. Then we may want to write
   a single script which records the sequence of commands, and then simply
   instruct each actor to follow the same script.

   scripts.

  shell (n.):

  Old English /sciell/, /scill/, Anglian /scell/ "seashell, eggshell," related to Old

  scale" (source also of West Frisian /skyl/ "peel, rind," Middle Low German /schelle/
  "pod, rind, egg shell," Gothic /skalja/ "tile"), with the shared notion of
  "covering that splits off," from PIE root *(s)kel- (1) "to cut, cleave" (source
  also of Old Church Slavonic /skolika/ "shell," Russian /skala/ "bark, rind;" see
  scale (n.1)). Italian /scaglia/ "chip" is from Germanic.

  Sense of "mere exterior" is from 1650s; that of "hollow framework" is from 1791.
  Meaning "structure for a band or orchestra" is attested from 1938. Military use
  (1640s) was first of hand grenades, in reference to the metal case in which the
  gunpowder and shot were mixed; the notion is of a "hollow object" filled with
  explosives. Hence shell shock, first recorded 1915. Shell game "a swindle" is
