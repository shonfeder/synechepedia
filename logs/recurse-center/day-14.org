#+TITLE: Day 14: Weekend Whoops
#+DATE: <2019-10-06 Sun>

I just realized I mistitled my entry from Friday as a weekend post. Whoops.

I spent most of the day with my spouse.

* Today's Progress

** PLT
I'll be reading [cite:@reynolds74_towar] tonight before bed.

** OCaml Ecosystem
I spent a couple hours working on the port of =Data.These=, mostly fiddling with
modules to reproduce type-class gimmicks.

* Tomorrow's Program

** PLT:
*** 1ML
- Actually hack on fixing type-checking bugs
- Study and write up notes on the distinction between small and large types
** Community
- Pairing on dungen generation in OCaml! :D
