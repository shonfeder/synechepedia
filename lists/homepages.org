* Bob Atkey

Researcher on PLT with a really fascinating mix of work.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
My research is on programming languages. I use mathematical ideas and structure
from logic, category theory, type theory, and denotational semantics to study
programming languages and the systems they describe.

Researcher in Logic, studied under Girard.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 My research interests are in the proof-theory of second order logic (System F)
 and linear logic (especially proof-nets).

Parametric polymorphism, the central topic of second order proof-theory, lies at
the border between mathematics, computer science, and philosophy. It can be
considered as the mathematical counterpart of the old philosophical problem of
impredicativity. Also, polymorphism is a well-known tool of many programming
languages and has deep connections with category theory (dinaturality, coherence
theorems, fibrations).
