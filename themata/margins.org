#+TITLE: Margins

Tho oxymoronic, work that is marginal in its time has had a tendency to be
centered by major developments subsequently. Yet even were marginal work always
relegated to historical margins, it would be no less important. Marginalia
appears in the open space at the edges precisely because the worker cannot fit
it into the main body of the text, perhaps because they are not empowered with
authorship, or because it is an afterthought, or because the note is just too
odd. What is worth marking but cannot find its place in the central flow if text
is well worth remarking.
