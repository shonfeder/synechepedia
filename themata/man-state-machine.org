#+TITLE: The Man/State/Machine

*WIP*

gist: I suspect that determination of human being terms of /man/, of ontology in
terms of /machine/, and of community in terms of /state/ are inextricably
intertwined. Particular forms such the state-machine, man-machine, and the state
as machine, are iterations of this mutual determination. The internal logic of
these determinations is that of command/control, impulse/reaction, and of the
discrete and orderable sequenced according to manly dictates. It runs through
all of modernity (even tho not all enlightenment thinking is thoroughly
subordinated to this framing), and it is driving us into madness, xenocide,
mono-mania, and other bad stuff.

-----

Who will thrive and predominate in a world thoroughly dominated by the
ideology of the man/state/machine? Whoever is most able to embody the qualities
of man that enable calculating the state and driving the machine: i.e.,
fortunate, masculine, technocrats, who can internalize the combinatory problems
relevant to tracking the state transitions, who can work the levers effectively,
or find clever and self serving ways to throw wrenches into the machine.

The opening passage from Hobbes' *Leviathan*:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Nature (the Art whereby God hath made and governes the World) is by the *Art* of
man, as in many other things, so in this also imitated, that it can make an
Artificial Animal. For seeing life is but a motion of Limbs, the beginning
whereof is in some principall part within; why may we not say, that all
/Automata/ (Engines that move themselves by springs and wheeles as doth a watch)
have an artificiall life? For what is the /Heart/, but a /Spring/; and the
/Nerves/, but so many /Strings/; and the /Joynts/, but so many /Wheels/, giving
motion to the whole Body, such as was intended by the Artificer? /Art/ goes yet
further, imitating that Rationall and most excellent worke of Nature, /Man/. For
by Art is created that great Leviathan called a Common-Wealth, or **State**, (in
latine Civitas) which is but *an Artificiall Man*
#+END_QUOTE


I think the essay would  make the case that the origin, essential logic, and
ultimate destiny of the the state-machine  concept is the subordination of the
human being to the man/state/machine.

Turing, in the "Computable Numbers" paper begins his description of the
"Computing machines" thus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We may compare a man in the process of computing a real number to a machine
which is only capable of a finite number of conditions /q1, q2, ..., qR/ which
will e called "/m/-configurations".
#+END_QUOTE


And immediately preceding, he notes the justification for this comparison:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
the justification lies in the fact that the human memory is necessarily
limited.
#+END_QUOTE


What makes a man/machine fully determinable (fully controlled?)?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If at each stage the motion of a machine is /completely/ determined by the
configuration, we shall call the machine an "automatic machine".
#+END_QUOTE


Turing also names another kind of machine, the "choice machine":

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For some purposes we might use machines (choice machines or *c*-machines) whose
motion is only partially determined by the configuration ... When such a machine
reaches one of these ambiguous configurations, it cannot go on until some
arbitrary choice has been made by an external operator. (72)
#+END_QUOTE

Hobbes (for whom "*Imagination* and *Memory* are but one thing" (89), also
maintained the finitude of memory:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Whatsoever we imagine, is *Finite*. Therefore there is no Idea, or conception
of anything we call *Infinite*.
#+END_QUOTE

And rendered Imagination as motion from mechanical impact of bodies on sense
organs. Reason is the orderly and deterministic sequencing of such impressions
in a train, after the impressions have been encoded into words:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When a man *Reasoneth*, hee does nothing else but conceive a summe totall, from
*Addition* of parcels; or conceive a Remainder, from *Subtraction* of one summe
from another: which (if it be done by Words,) is conceiving of the consequences
of the names of all the parts, to the name of the whole; or from the names of
the whole and on epart, to the name of the other part. (110)

...

For Reason, in this sense, is nothing but *Reckoning* (that is, Adding and
Subtracting) of the Consequences of generall names agreed upon, for the
*marking* and *signifying* of our thoughts.
#+END_QUOTE

He casts Science as the knowledge of consequence revealed by this right
ordering. (See p. 115) Essential to scientific reasoning is the elimination of
ambiguity:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Light of humane minds is Perspicuous Words, but by exact definitions first
snuffed, and purged from ambiguity; *Reason* is the *pace*; Encrease of
*Science*, the *way*; and the Benefit of man-kind, the *end*.
#+END_QUOTE

The destiny of a redemable human being, in Hobbe's view, is only via the
subordination of everything, both human and nature, to the man/state/machine,
via linguistic programming (or, as he calls it, "Science"):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The only way to erect such a Common Power, as may be able to defend them from
the invasion of Forraigners, and the injuries of one another ... is, to conferre
all their power and strength upon one Man, or upon one Assembly of men, that may
reduce all their Wills, by plurality of voices, unto one Will
#+END_QUOTE


* TODO re: Lacan

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There is nothing here, however, that contradicts the vast dialectic that makes
us serfs of history by superimposing its waves on the brewing of our grand
migrations, in what attaches each of us to a scrap of discourse that is more
alive than his very life, if it is true that, as Goethe said, when "that which
is without life is alive, it can also produce life".

For it is also true that, having been unable to proffer this scrap of discourse
from our throats, each of us is condemned to make himself into its living
alphabet to trace out its fatal line.

* TODO re: Longo's letter's to turing

In a letter addressed posthumously to Alan Turing, Giuseppe Longo laments the
conceptual and technological cul-de-sac into which the state machinsts are
driving us:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To this we have to add the madness, as I mentioned, of the "everything is
computational", starting from the analysis of the living, the opposite of what
you [Turing] were able to offer, and creating the myth of the Universe as a
Turing Machine, against your very precise observations. These colleagues, who
are using the only technique that they know, and applying it to every possible
phenomenon, flattening it onto a universe that is witout meaning and made only
of formal calculations, act as if yours is the last machine that [humans] will
be capable of inventing: it is coterminous with the world! I am convinced that
we shall invent others, but these prophesies risk becoming self-affirming:
piling computational techniques onto computational techniques, always in the
same theoretical universe, to grasp the complexity of the Universe (or the brain,
of DNA ...), in increasingly and abstrusively difficult ways without the very
simple purity and depth that mathematical invention requires -- all of this
prevents us from being able to think about the ... next machine, which humankind
will certainly find ways of inventing.

* TODO Etymology

State is derived

#+begin_quote
directly from /status/ "a station, position, place; way of standing, posture;
order, arrangement, condition,"
#+end_quote

and then figuratively a

#+begin_quote
"standing, rank; public order, community organization,"
#+end_quote

Consult the hypothesized PIE root to see that /state/ is rooted in the notion of
a static standing, a set arrangement.

https://www.etymonline.com/word/state#etymonline_v_22015

State as in stasis, position, a standing. The notion of a state as "political
organization of a country, supreme civil power, government" dates from c. 1300.

Concretely and primarily, [[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dstatus2][/status/]] conveyed a gradient of senses from physical
posture, appearance, or stature, to position in space. Only  figuratively and
derivatively did it come to mean one's social position, i.e., social status. And
by this route, finally, to mean "of countries, communities, etc., the condition of
society, or the state, the public order, public affairs".

Note that this determines sociality and the being together of community through
static positionality and arrangement (this will become state in the sense of
situated and configured resources) in a field of relative power or influence.
Status still has this sense. The concept of the state has always intended an
ordering of people based on static accumulation and hierarchical positioning.

* Positioning: pro-civilization/anti-state

As per Bookchin, the state is opposed to, other than, and imposed at the expense
of the urbs/city. Civilization as understood as a social order organized around
the life of the civilis "relating to a citizen, relating to public life,
befitting a citizen; popular, affable, courteous" ([[https://www.etymonline.com/word/civilize?ref=etymonline_crossreference][etymonline]]).

*** School as a machine that should belong to the state

#+begin_quote
We confront the whole programme, as an aggregate and all in all its parts, with
the generic proposition that the public school should be made neither a Catholic
nor a Protestant machine, ay more than it should be made a Jewish, a Mormon, or
an infidel machine. It should be a State machine ...

* TODO The State of Man

** Jean Bodin's "Six Books..."

https://constitution.org/2-Authors/bodin/bodin_1.htm

#+begin_quote
A COMMONWEALTH may be defined as the rightly ordered government of a number of
families, and of those things which are their common concern, by a sovereign
power. 
#+end_quote

*** Manly hierarchical control as founding principle

#+begin_quote
A FAMILY may be defined as the right ordering of a group of persons owing
obedience to a head of a household, and of those interests which are his proper
concern. 
#+end_quote

But this wasn't even consistently used as the organizing principle. Only
/certain/ males were allotted the defining role of head of household. 

#+begin_quote
From the moment a marriage is consummated the woman is subject to her husband,
unless he is still living as a dependant in his father's house. Neither slaves
nor other dependants have any authority over their wives, still less over their
children. They are all subject to the head of the family until such time as he
shall have given his married son his independence. No household can have more
than one head, one master, one seigneur. If there were more than one head there
would be a conflict of command and incessant family disturbances... wherefore a
woman marrying a man still living in his father's house is subject to her
father-in-law. ...
#+end_quote


*** Control and command as the foundation of the state:

#+begin_quote
The government of all commonwealths, colleges, corporate bodies, or households
whatsoever, rests on the right to command on one side, and the obligation to
obey on the other, which arises when the natural liberty which each man has to
live as he chooses, is exercised subject to the power of another.
