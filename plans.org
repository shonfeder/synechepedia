* A writing assistant

  Akin to a proof assistant.

** Relates, coordinates, and organizes concepts
   - defining terms (and checking for consistent usage)
   - specifying equivalences (synonyms)
   - systematic disambiguation of homonymous terms
   - specifies entailments (inclusion)
     - can use wordnet for sub-concept inclusion detections/tests?
** Strucures /passages/
   - passages are transitions or pathways from one /notion/ to another.
   - A /notion/ is a complex of concepts & compounding terms (syncategorematic).
*** Some example patterns of passages
    - source_1 :: topic sentence
    - target_1 :: conclusion statement
    - source_2 :: hypothetical (if x holds, then y follows)
    - target_2 :: drawing conclusion
    - source_3 :: question
    - target_3 :: answer
    - source_4 :: question
    - target_4 :: expanded question or sub-question
*** Passages nest and branch
    E.g.,

    - topic
      - question ... answer
      - question ... answer
    - conclusion
** Tests/explorations
   Generates variant senses, presented to the author for review, so they can
   anticipate misunderstandings or elaborate along previously unconsidered lines
   of thought.

   With relatively simple transformations, can generate things like

   - valid inferences
   - alternate interpretations
   - rephrasings

   (Can be considered a form of refactoring)
** Transitions
   These link passages. They are special kinds of passages, which are schemas
   for coordinating passages.
   - should be modular
   - they are /tropes/ like analogy, metaphor, synonym expansion, association of
     concepts, etc.
