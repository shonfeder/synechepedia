#+TITLE: Day 2: Disorientation
#+DATE: <2019-09-24 Tue>

* Vibe
Low and fragile feeling, but people were kind and engaging, learning happend and
work got done.

* Today's Progress

** Community
- Had a lovely walk and chat facilitated by the chat-bot.
- Pairing workshop: I learned the value of frequent alternation between roles
  (they advised 8-15 minutes rotations). My partner and I coded up a working
  (afaik) implementation of the core logic of Conway's Game of Life in Haskell.
  This was a good reminder that my Haskell is very rough.
- Met with the category theory study group kickoff. We have solid plans for the
  next meeting.
- Signed up with the pairing bot and made a date with a fellow batchling for
  some OCaml pairing tomorrow.
** Tooling : Emacs × org-mode × blog
- Fixed a bug in the org-publish configuration preventing posts from being
  indexed properly.
** PLT: 1ML × Type Theory
Less progress here than hoped. Between my exhaustion and social engagements, I
didn't have a heap of energy or time, but I still managed to move things
forward a bit.

- Got the 1ML interpreter building.
- Fixed some bugs in my year-old experiments to extend the prelude.
- Added some to the =Opt= module

I still have a lot to sort out.

* Tomorrow's Program

** PLT
- Finish reading cite:macqueen84_modul_ml
- Begin reading cite:Rossberg_2010
- Solidify understanding of distinction between small and large types in 1ML,
  and how to use =wrap= and =unwrap= appropriately.
- Code up some basic data structures, starting with a stack.
- Backup, in case I am stuck or need a break: Begin porting =Data.These= to
  OCaml
** Community
- OCaml pairing
- OCaml chatting
- Recoup with some dedicated alone time.
** Writing
- Short write up on the basics of defining 1ML modules.
