#+title: Buying A Fridge

Notes on buying a fridge.

Top-mounted freezers are [[https://homeguides.sfgate.com/energy-top-freezer-vs-bottom-freezer-88513.html]["10 to 25 percent" more energy efficient]] than
bottom-mounted freezeers when the compressor is bottom-mounted, since it places
the freezer further from the compressor, which generates heat.

However, it seems that the optimal configuration would then be top-mounted
compressor and bottom-mounted freezer, since it would allow the heat (which
rises) to radiate out with least interference to any cooling compartments.
