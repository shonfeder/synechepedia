The formula `A B` should express some relation between the referrant or
correlate of A with the referrant or correlate of B.

when considering whether the statement expressed in `A B` is true, we have to
consider the complete system of analogies at work:

`A` : `B` :: (the signs)
 A  :  B  :: (the notions/concepts)
 A' :  B'    (the referents)

We can have breakdown or missteps at any point. Moreover, when we've made
semantic or transcendental ascent, there may be various forms of abstraction or
generalization mediating between the stages of the analogy.
