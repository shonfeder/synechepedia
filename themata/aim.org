#+TITLE: Aim

/A perpetual work in progress.../

* My Aim

To work towards ways of mediating the tension between /poetic origination/ and
/technical formation/ in service of a /communalistic emancipation/ of our
/existential thrown and givenness/.

* Elaboration

** Terminology

- poetic origination :: The process of originating forms of expression,
  conceptual spaces, expressive paradigms, ways of thinking, feeling, and
  inhabiting. Cf. Scott Buchanan, Walter Benjamin, and Martin Heidegger,
- technical formation :: The [[https://monoskop.org/Cultural_techniques][techniques]] through which we form, process, order,
  sequence, mechanize, and automate everything from our ways of understanding
  and processing the world to our production of new technologies themselves. Cf.
  Heideggerian and post-Heideggerian technocriticism, first generation Frankfurt
  School critique of instrumental reason, and critiques and analyses of
  formalism and mechanization advanced by GoÌˆdel, Turing, Girard and the like.
- communalistic :: With a nod towards Bookchin's "libertarian municipalism", this
  invokes [[file:~/Dropbox/synechepedia/org/reading-notes/nancy-the-inoperative-community.org][Jean-Luc Nancy's writing of community]] as "a whole of articulated
  singularities" (cite:peter01): it means /to be/ in communication with others and
  to find the end and origin of being together in that articulate sharing.
- emancipation :: The liberation of children from the dominating imposition
  of their parent's programming and conditioning. This is a special case
  of the liberation of the oppressed and exploited from the grip of the
  extractors who feed off them, but it is /the most special case/, since the
  perpetuation of extractive domination is strictly dependant upon the
  reproduction of successive, vulnerable generations.

* What is an "Aim"?[fn:mission]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*aim* (v.)

c. 1300, "to estimate (number or size), calculate, count" (senses now obsolete),
from Old French /aesmer/, /esmer/ (Old North French /amer/) "to value, rate; count,
estimate," ultimately from Latin /aestimare/ "appraise, determine the value of"
(see esteem (v.)).

Meaning in English apparently developed from "calculate," to "calculate with a
view to action, plan," then to "direct a missile, a blow, etc."

#+END_QUOTE

In our current, common sense, /aiming/ is concerned with focusing intention on a
specific, significant region of what is within our field of view. I mean it in
this sense. But let the older senses sound through too: when I speak of my
(always only provisional) /aim/, let the target in view also be considered in
terms of estimation, calculation, valuation. My aim is an estimation of what I
can meaningfully contribute to in an essential capacity. It is a way of guiding
the calculations that determine my resource expenditure, and a means of
calibrating my values.

* Footnotes

[fn:mission] I considered naming this theme 'mission', but am wary of the
religious connotations of that word and of its debasement by extractive
organizations marketing themselves as "mission driven" on the job market.
