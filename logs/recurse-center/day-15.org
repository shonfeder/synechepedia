#+TITLE: Day 15: Procedural Generation of Nested Places
#+DATE: <2019-10-07 Mon>

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The very understanding of spatiality as paradigmatically a concept of physical
theory, and so as primarily tied to physical extension, must represent a
fundamental obstacle to any attempt to arrive at a view of place as a
philosophically significant concept. ... the analysis of place must encompass a
broader analysis of space that does not restrict space merely to the sense
associated with notions of physical extension and position. Arriving at an
adequate account of place, then, requires a rethinking of space also.

* Today's Progress

** Community
I was lucky enough to enjoy *2* wonderful pairing sessions today.

- In the first session, we got to practice Haskell while working over some good
  foundational algorithms on lists. I had a bunch of fun, and learned and
  relearned some important principles.
- In the second, we made tangible initial progress on implementing a procedural
  dungeon generator. This was a blast and very illuminating. I'm going to keep
  working on this as a fun and instructive side project.

** PLT: 1ML
- Got the remote repo up to date with changes I've been making on my fork
- Moved my project planing notes into the fork. You can see them [[https://github.com/shonfeder/1ml/blob/interlude/PROJECT.org][here]].
- I made some actual progress on the 1ML type checking bug that's currently in
  my cross hairs. I've been [[https://github.com/shonfeder/1ml/blob/interlude/PROJECT.org#next-type-checking-error-reads-access-of-module-values-as-if-it-were-the-module-itself-being-supplied-as-a-value][documenting the bug hunt]] pretty carefully, so I'll
  be able to reuse the debugging techniques I'm discovering along the way later
  with ease. *Documentation is Automation!*[fn:2]

** Writing
I received some very encouraging feedback on this log.

The feedback came along with a great suggestion for a missing feature: a way of
tracking what reported progress is contributing to which project. I suspect I
can achieve such a thing with some basic use of org-mode tags. I've added the
idea to my todo list.

We also discussed difficulties around writing in general, the risks of writing
publically, and the ambiguous nature of mixing genuine self-expression with
instrumental self-promotion.

This rambling mess of a log a manifestation of my own attempts to develop a
writing practice, and to overcome the stifling forces of unrealistic expectation
and scope creep. So far so good, in that writing is happening. However, I'm
still very far from feeling confident in my abilities to write Î» /needs/ .[what
/needs/ to be written to communicate what /needs/ to be communicated][fn:1].
Perhaps once I feel more confident in my ability to write coherently towards a
particular purpose, I'll try to summarize how well this method of bootstrapping
such a habit has worked for me (or hasn't).

In the meantime, I am very grateful for the people who have shared insight into
their own writing process, shared their own writing, encouraged writing in
general, offered feedback, or invited the opportunity to give feedback.

* Tomorrow's Program

** PLT
- Focused work on the 1ML type checking bug
- Discussing CT prior to Wednesday's meeting
 
** Community
- Signed up to give a non-technical talk on critical theory. I'll need to prep for
  this!

* Footnotes

[fn:2] https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/6/228040-documentation-is-automation/abstract

[fn:1] A jokey experiment in parameterizing the value of a word without the
usual boilerplate phrase: "for some value of /x/". Probably a failed experiment.
