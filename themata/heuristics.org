#+TITLE: Heuristics

A list of maxims, tips, and tricks which I hope will help me to live more
carefully and effectively.

- Stand up slowly, and get low quickly if you feel dizzy.
- Demand to be let out of the car ASAP if you feel a driver is not being safe.
- Write and run tests before investing in documentation, application, or
  generalization.
- Devote time to document-producing design planning prior to starting work.
- Use checklists to ensure safe and complete execution of important tasks.
- Implement minimal essential functionality, put it under test to verify
  correctness and guard against regressions, *then* elaborate.
