#+TITLE: Heuristics

A list of maxims, tips, and tricks which I hope will help me live more carefully
and effectively.

- Stand up slowly, and get low quickly if you feel dizzy.
- Demand to be let out of the car ASAP if you feel a driver is not being safe.
- Write and run tests before investing in documentation, application, or
  generalization.
