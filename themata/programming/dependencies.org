#+title: Dependencies

"Classical logic is the logic of complete information ... it's the logic of a
closed world" (Harper's 2015 OPLSA lecture:

reference.)

The question of whether we should have a constructive or a classical approach to
dependency management should hinge on whether this is a domain in which we
should expect to have complete information.
