# Response to Martin-Löf on Analytic and Synthetic Judgements

*The Scope of the Essay*

As a way into the essay, I’ll begin with M-L's claim that he is performing a “modern analogue of Kant’s metaphysical deduction of the categories.” The first thing to note is that in the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant carries out two deductions of the categories, a *metaphysical* deduction followed by a *transcendental* deduction. The metaphysical deduction, consisting of 12 pages in the Guyer translation, concerns for the most part the "Clue to the Discovery of all Pure Concepts of the Understanding." This "Clue" sets up a mapping between the "Table of Judgements" (an exhaustive list of the forms of possible judgement) and the "Table of Categories" (an exhaustive list of concepts that can be applied a priori to objects of intuition). As Heidegger I think rightly points out, “*the table of judgement contains the indices for the number and systems of categories, but this table is not the source of their origin*” (*Phenomenological Interpretation of Kant*, 198). Which is to say, we don’t begin with “the forms of judgment of logic as it was current at his time” (Martin-Löf, 93) (or current at any given time) and then deduce from those forms of judgement what would then be the categories. Rather, the clue allows one to move by hypothesis from the judgements to the categories. If it’s the case that “the same function that gives unity to the different representations **in a judgement** also gives unity to the mere synthesis of different representations **in an intuition**” (A79/B104), then an exhaustive list of the forms of judgements can be mapped on to an exhaustive list of categories. But, a transcendental deduction, on the other hand, is “the explanation of the way in which concepts can relate to objects a priori” (A85/B117). [#REF1] The clue assumes this relation, whereas the deduction justifies it.

Obviously, it is unfair to accuse Martin-Löf of incompleteness when one could argue that we are merely dealing with an essay that is proposing an interesting parallel? an interesting direction for further research? or perhaps it is just a historical note to install Kant within a certain tradition? Regardless, I think we should pay attention to the fact that in this "modern analogue" to Kant, we are missing an essential element of the analogy, namely, the actual argumentation that links the table of judgements with the table of categories, which would be the *transcendental* deduction of the categories. Why is this essential piece missing? Why isn't even noted that it is missing and needs to be supplied in another work or by someone else in some future endeavor?

Part of the reason is that there is a confused scope at work in Martin-Löf's essay. On the one hand, Martin-Löf seems to want to confine his remarks to "this limited area of logic and philosophy of mathematics." In which case, the objects of his study would fall under the region (to use Husserl's terminology) of mathematical objects but also, and more problematically, to the region of logical objects. On the other hand, by using the term category, I think Martin-Löf is not only committing himself to some form transcendental idealism (which he alludes to at the end of the essay) but more importantly, it means that his paper is dealing with transcendental logic. Transcendental logic, as opposed to general logic, is the "science of pure understanding and of the pure cognition of reason, by means of which we think objects completely a priori" (A57/B81). As such, any discussion of the categories pertains to all cognition (Erkenntnis) and the necessary elements of experience outside of the moral and aesthetic spheres. So I think there is a double gesture in Martin-Löf's essay where he claims (perhaps with false modesty?) a limited scope for the work, but in fact, what he is discussing has a much wider import that would, I'll argue later, change every thing. Part of the issue, though, is to what extent we can tinker with Kant, taking some components while leaving others behind. I leave that as an open question, but the difficult work of the transcendental deduction is elided by Martin-Löf, and therefore the double question of the subject and experience is not accounted for (though the latter appears briefly in the examples leading up to the main discussion).


*The History of Analyticity*

1) What does it mean to have a "modern analogue of Kant's metaphysical deduction of the categories" (p. 92)?


    - M-L's method seems to be that one can survey (through induction?) the current state of logic and then from there deduce the categories


        - which implies that logic is historical, though no account of this historicity is given


        - which would in turn imply that our experience is historical


    - to what extent does "analogy" control M-L's argument?


        - this is where I'd want to potentially compare the analytic tradition with the continental (or at least Derrida)


            - [trace idea of "substitutability" in Leibniz and Frege's *Philosophy of Arithmetic* as it pertains to identity]


                - the aim of analyticity would be a substitution without loss, a specific type of exchange (which would fall under laws of economy)


        - [the crucial question: to what extent is "identity" a special case of "analogy"?]

- Kant sets up a form between two terms (the mapping between judgement and category) that is valid, but for M-L, the first term is invalid and needs to be "updated" for a modern time


    - [part of my own argument is to assume the truth of this form, but show that it has potentially unwanted consequences if M-L gives a different first term]


- M-L argues that there is a hidden analyticity at the heart of synthetic judgements, yet one could argue the converse


    - after all, M-L sets out a brief history of analyticity, and what justifies here the correct concept of analyticity? can one even reasonably argue that there is an analytic concept of analyticity?


    - especially in light of the fact that M-L has completely changed the meaning of analyticity, which until his proposal, had been predominantly defined as a relation between concepts, but now has expanded to also include states of affairs


    - is M-L's new concept of analyticity considered as a discovery that has eluded prior thinkers? or is it a reflection of our current historical situation with our particular desiderata for conceptuality?


        - [the latter not being a critique but a call for a fuller account]



*Tautological Analyticity*

this section is more tentative

for M-L, shift from: whether a (linguistic) proposition applies to a (non-linguistic) state of affairs (which would be synthetic), to: analysis of the proposition-state of affairs complex (analytic)


    - it seems that there is a sleight-of-hand happening here


        - to say that the complex is true is to assume its truth, and the analyticity appears when one concludes that "if it's true, then it's true"


        - (p. 89) "if you look at the whole complex as a judgement, consisting of a nonlinguistic part, the falling rain, and a properly linguistic part, the utterance, then that judgement is an analytic one"

this section needs to be expanded in the light of the following section


*What is a Category?*

M-L's argument operates under the mapping between forms of judgement and categories


    - as outlined in the first section, we should keep in mind the *experiential* component of categories


    - two key Kantian categories: the *hypothetical* form of judgement maps on to *causality*; the *categorical* form of judgement maps on to *substance*


    - if we are going through a "modern analogue" of Kant's deduction, then what is the experiential analogue of the three types of judgment that M-L sets forth?

two detours from Kant:


    1) Kant offers a *taxonomy* of (twelve forms of) logical judgements, while M-L substitutes for these Kantian forms of judgement three *axioms* of type theory


        - I'm not sure what the consequences of this might be, just noting the difference


    2) for Kant, the form of judgement maps on to a category; for M-L, a category is *one of the terms of the judgement*


        - (p. 91) - "[a simply theory of types] makes a judgement of the form *a* : α. Such a judgement says that *a* is an object of type α, where Kant would have said category instead of type, category of pure concept of understanding"


        - with this statement, the form of the analogy is obliterated


            *-* rather than mapping judgements on to categories in order to show *how* concepts can apply *a priori* to experience, this first "basic form of categorical judgement employed by type theory" merely states *that* there is subsumption, that is, some individual is an element of a set/type


            - [see B171/A132 on subsumption - what activity is elided here by appealing to a "mother-wit"?]


            - "if it wanted to show generally how one ought to subsume under these rules, i.e., distinguish whether something stands under them or not, this could not happen except once again through a rule. But just because this is a rule, it would demand another instruction for the power of judgment, and so it becomes clear that al­ though the understanding is certainly capable of being instructed and equipped through rules, the power of judgment is a special talent that cannot be taught but only practiced. Thus this is also what is specific to so-called mother-wit, the lack of which cannot be made good by any school"


        - to put subsumption at the origin makes it unnecessary to go through the *transcendental* deduction


            - therefore, one need not worry about the subject (the transcendental ego) or time


            - the transcendental deduction deals with what it means to be an object, what it means to be a concept, what it means to have knowledge; type theory, again, just states these by fiat in an axiomatization that states that all three exist, and that the only thing interesting about them is the relationship of subsumption


                - [again, M-L doesn't *have* to go into first philosophy or ontology to discuss issues of logic and the philosophy of mathematics; yet, there are certain commitments at stake in type theory in general, but in particular, here, where the concept of "category" is evoked]


*Is Subsumption the Only Form of Judgment?*


    it seems that in a type theoretical universe, there can only be individuals and types, and the relation between the two is the question of subsumption


    is this a defining feature of the analytic tradition? probably too reductive, but it seems that starting with Frege, then Russell, it is largely a question of how to refine this question of subsumption


        - sets, types, (non-Kantian) categories are all attempts to shore up this relation, to make it air-tight, to make it paradox-free, etc.


        - which is fine and noble, and not illusory, and important

however, Kant offers us at least two other ways for individuals to relate to concepts:


    1) aesthetic judgement - where the universal isn't available, and therefore subsumption cannot happen or has to happen otherwise


        - [would need much more reading to fill this point out]


    2) pure intuition


        - "Now one must, to be sure, think of every concept as a representation that is contained in an infinite set of different possible representations (as their common mark), which thus contains these **under itself**; but no concept, as such, can be thought as if it contained an infinite set of representations **within itself**. Nevertheless space is so thought (for all the parts of space, even to infinity, are simultaneous). Therefore the original representation of space is an a priori intuition, not a concept.>" (A25/B40)


        - the "under" relationship would be what leads to set theory and its successors


        - for Kant, of course, the "within" relationship is essential to the "under" relationship


            - this "within" relationship brings with it, in Kant, the question of time and the question of the subject (as what or who experiences, and pure intuition, as non-discursive, must be experienced)


            - maybe "within" relationship has its successor in topology? but this is space


        - Benjamin, I think, in his essay "On Language as such..." tries to understand language as pure intuition rather than as one of subsumption (token/type)
