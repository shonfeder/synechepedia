#+TITLE: Existence


If we take logic seriously, existential quantification should be intimately
related to the problematics of existence per se.

I wonder if [[./synechism.org][synechistic]] post-structuralism can be understdood as a skolemization
of existenialism that helps rescue it from the anthropocentric relativism
towards which it tends. Where existentialism insists on existence preceding
essence, synechistic post-structuralism lets us reinterpret existence as a
continuum of structures mapping parameters pertaining to a continuum of possible
universal properties to into concrete forms through discretion.
