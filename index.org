** What is a 'Synechepedia'? <<what-is-a-synechepedia>>

'Synechepedia' is a portmanteau of '[[file:themata/synechism.org][synechism]]' and '[[file:themata/encyclopedia.org][encyclopedia]]'.

- [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-pedia][/-pedia/]] :: relates to learning via a back-formation of /encyclopedia/. In
  contemporary usage it indicates a "specialized encyclopedia about the prefix
  (e.g., 'Investopedia') or a general encyclopedia in the structure of the
  prefix". In accordance with its Greek root [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%80%CE%B1%CE%B9%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%B1#Ancient_Greek][παιδεία]], I want the /-pedia/ to
  also mark a concern for raising up ourselves and each other. Let it relate to
  learning and education in its most emancipatory and transformative potential.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synechism][/syneche-/]] :: from [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%87%CE%AE%CF%82#Greek][συνεχής]], meaning "constant, continuous, sustained", is meant
  in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce][Peircean]] sense employed in /synechism/, but the connotations of
  constant and sustained is wellcome.

Whereas an encyclopedia seeks to provide general or encompassing instruction,
and a /foopedia/ aims to be an encyclopedia of /foo/, this /synechepedia/
eschews generality and containment. The synechepedia is meant to serve the cause
of emancipatory education (my own, at the very least) through a sustained effort
to connect thoughts, clues, quotes, references, and questions which -- though
always converging towards a more harmonious continuity -- have abandoned all
hope of achieving completion.
