There is no impartial determination of wholeness.

The self is an integration of disparate thoughts, feelings, and beings that take
place.

Disentangle the sorrow bound around the particular ways in which you are
disintegrating.

Acknowledge the sadness that speaks of our disintegrated beloveds.

Let the disintegration of this aspect of self appear just as it is.

Every moment of disintegration is integral to life.
