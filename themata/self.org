#+title: Self

Self is about reflection. The conscious sense of self must be a fixpoint:
a function of phenomena which is identified with a fiber of what's given. The
sense of self, what is taken to be the same that spans different moments of
differentiation and integration, is not itself fixed. The self can be detached,
fragmentary, fleeting, fixated, fused, or seeming absent all together.

Self may be thought as a process or activity: we self some phenomena for some
time. Eventually, in the course of time, it seems that selfing stops (and
mightn't that be like a great, relaxing sigh into dissolution?). While we are
selfing, we sometimes self things we later abhor, and aspire to selfing things
that will never be within our grasp. And what we actually self all the wile is
itsef unsteady and flickering. Tho there is the rhythm and the recurrence, and
tho the function changes overtime, there is the fixpoint, whose structure is
eternal, tho the duration is just a blink.
