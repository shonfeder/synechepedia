#+TITLE: Thinking

Hypothesis: What we call "thinking" is essentially *intuited conception*
(/angeschaut Begriffung/, meaning both terms in their Kantian sense). This
intuiting is obscured, usually appearing transparent, so the objects of thought
are usually taken to be thought as such. This overlooked intuiting is largely
responsible for the indeterminacy in most treatments of thinking.
