* Comparisons
** TODO Denotational Design
Denotation is about reference and semantics, referentially conceived.
Semiotics is about sense and pragmatics, inferentially conceived.

** TODO "Domain Driven Design"

Domain driven design is informal and adhoc, i.e. coloquial and context specific.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*ad hoc*
Latin phrase, "to this, with respect to this, for this (specific purpose)," from
ad "to" (see /ad-/) + /hoc/, neuter accusative of hic "this." Hence, "appointed or
enacted for some particular purpose" (1879).
