* Reconciling Formal Foundations with the Infinite

The core problematic addressed in the work, that which intuitionistic type
theory (ITT) is meant to be an answer to, is that of raising a firm formal
foundation of mathematical reasoning which is consistent, complete *over
it's domain*, and capable of grounding reasoning over infinite domains.

* Putting Form and Meaning Together

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We will avoid keeping form and meaning (content) apart. Instead we will  at the
same time display certain forms of judgment and inference that re used in
mathematical proofs and explain them semantically. Thus we make explicit what is
usually implicitly taken for granted. When one treats logic as any other branch
of mathematics, as in the metamathematical tradition originated by Hilbert, such
judgments and inferences are only partially and formally represented in the
so-called object language, while they are implicitly used, as in any other
branch of mathematics, in the so-called metalanguage.
#+END_QUOTE

This practice of developing the meanings and use of judgment at the same time,
expecting the one to inform the other through the process of the exposition and
use is familiar and essential to the continental philosophical tradition.
