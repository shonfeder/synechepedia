#+TITLE: Programming

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We believe that programming can be, and should be, an intellectually
rewarding activity; that a good programming language is a powerful
conceptual tool — a tool for organizing, expressing, experimenting with, and
even communicating one's thoughts ... we think that programming can be, and
should be, part of the problem solving process itself; that thoughts should
be organized as programs, so that consequences of a complex set of
assumptions can be investigated by "running" the assumptions; that a
conceptual solution to a problem should be developed hand-in-hand with a
working program that demonstrates it and exposes its different aspects.
