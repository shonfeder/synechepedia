Planned projects. Sketches. Glimpses.

* A writing assistant

  Akin to a proof assistant.

** Relates, coordinates, and organizes concepts
   - defining terms (and checking for consistent usage)
   - specifying equivalences (synonyms)
   - systematic disambiguation of homonymous terms
   - specifies entailments (inclusion)
     - can use wordnet for sub-concept inclusion detections/tests?
** Strucures /passages/
   - passages are transitions or pathways from one /notion/ to another.
   - A /notion/ is a complex of concepts & compounding terms (syncategorematic).
*** Some example patterns of passages
    - source_1 :: topic sentence
    - target_1 :: conclusion statement
    - source_2 :: hypothetical (if x holds, then y follows)
    - target_2 :: drawing conclusion
    - source_3 :: question
    - target_3 :: answer
    - source_4 :: question
    - target_4 :: expanded question or sub-question
*** Passages nest and branch
    E.g.,

    - topic
      - question ... answer
      - question ... answer
    - conclusion
** Tests/explorations
   Generates variant senses, presented to the author for review, so they can
   anticipate misunderstandings or elaborate along previously unconsidered lines
   of thought.

   With relatively simple transformations, can generate things like

   - valid inferences
   - alternate interpretations
   - rephrasings

   (Can be considered a form of refactoring)
** Transitions
   These link passages. They are special kinds of passages, which are schemas
   for coordinating passages.
   - should be modular
   - they are /tropes/ like analogy, metaphor, synonym expansion, association of
     concepts, etc.
* Natural Deduction Games
** Mobile/web game
   - along the lines of Euclid that teaches
   - teaches principles and techniques
   - as you master elimination/introduction rules, you expand your abilities
   - as you identify important theorems, you get cuts that expand your powers
** Party game
   - Possible title: "Unnatural Deductions"
*** Ideas
    (Just a sketch)
    - Tile placing
      - scrabble:
        - building off each others sequences
        - can lay multiple tiles in a chain of deductions
      - hive
        - The "board" is constructed as tiles are placed
        - can revise the board shape by certain moves
          - (E.g. cuts)
    - Players state axioms
      - Axioms must be allowed by consensus (assumed consent, but a single veto
        blocks axiom positing)
    - Cuts can be declared
      - clears the board of (some) tiles
      - introduces new theorems
      - How?
        - Special "cut" tiles?
          - Allows for capturing tiles that are cut out
          - Can only add captured tiles to points if you can reintroduce the cut?
    - Win/loss conditions?
      - Immediate victory: Proving Falsum (should be rare)
      - Tile capturing: via cut introduction. And any other means?
    - Different logical systems as expansions
    - The content of the theorems provide color (like other party games)
    - Award points based also on amusingness of deduced theorems?
