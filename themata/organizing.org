*organ* (n.)

a fusion of late Old English organe, and Old French orgene (12c.), both meaning
"musical instrument," both from Latin organa, plural of organum "a musical
instrument," from Greek organon "implement, tool for making or doing; musical
instrument; organ of sense, organ of the body," literally "that with which one
works," from PIE *werg-ano-, from root *werg- "to do."

A society structured as

- a sym{caco{phonous}} organization.
- an arcane coercion : the nested subsystems compelling individuals into
  metrical polyrhythms.
