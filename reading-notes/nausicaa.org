#+title: Rereading Nausicaa of the Valley of th Wind

An epic for our time and the coming one

- Afflicted by balcanizing ideology
- Suffering from a world made dangerous and poisonous because of our mistreament
- At risk from deadly weapons
- Forgotten how to maintain or advance the core tech, because too much
  complexity for our degraded state.
- Nations fighting stupid war
- What we can do is give our all to care for those in need, to expand the circle
  of our concern, to live in love for the earth.
- Against any idealology of purity
